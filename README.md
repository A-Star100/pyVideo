# pyPlay
A simple Python media player app made with the PyQT libraries for UI and multimedia.

This project is just so people can play media with Python, and **will not** be properly maintained, as it is a side project. If you're looking for a more advanced, cross-platform video player (that doesn't use Python), check out [SimpliPlay](https://simpliplay.netlify.app), which supports a variety of media formats.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or later

- PyQT (version to install in requirements.txt - 5.1.5.11, latest as of Jan 26, 2025)

## After cloning the repo
Simply type 

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt   
```

inside the source code directory, then type

```shell
python3 main.py
```

and you should see a window with options to play, pause, stop, go fullscreen, scrub through progress (progress slider is buggy, be careful!), a URL input dialog and a choose file button. Use these however you would like :D
